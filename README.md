**Warning:** This is a very, very first draw of a python based respondd node. This must **not** on any productive environments. However it still works but there is a lot of work to be done until entering (pre-)alpha state. ;)

See [here](https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/packages/tree/master/net/respondd) to get more informations about respondd.

Docs, comments, license, etc. will follow very soon...
